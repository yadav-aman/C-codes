/* 
Abstract data types - Abstract data type is the way we look at a data structure, focusing on what it does and ignoring how it does its job.
Array is an example of abstract data type.
Another real life example of abstraction is that there are many trees that we can't remember their names but speaking abstractly we can say
that they are just trees, they have branches, leaves and so on.

As we know that arrays in C are static in nature i.e., they have a fixed size.
but if want to make a dynamic list with functions like append(), insert() and pop() (like in python), then we can do it by the use of Data Structures
